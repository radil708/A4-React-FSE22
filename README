############ DESCRIPTION ################
The code here is responsible for running 
the front end of social media twitter like 
website Tuitter. You can sign up for an
account, post tuits, like Tuits, and even post polls.

############ REQUIREMENTS ###############
React library for javascript

########### HOW TO RUN LOCALLY ##########
Note: I use intelliJ as my IDE and I use ubuntu
to execute commands, so I will provide instructions
on how to run the code using ubuntu and IntelliJ
but you can use your own environment and command
shell as long as you install the proper requirements
for them.

This server code was meant to run in conjuncion with 
my node (back end) code, which you can find here 
https://github.com/radil708/FSE22-Tuitter-Node.

Please read the README for the Tuitter Node
before proceeding.

3.) Open an ubuntu terminal and navigate to this repo.
4.) Run the command: npm start
5.) The Tuitter website will open up in a browser.
